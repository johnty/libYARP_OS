 *
 * A base-class for standard Yarp modules.  If you're building a large
 * system and want to regularize how parts of your system are
 * configured and run, this class may be helpful to you.  Modules are
 * expected to be configurable via IConfig::open() -- in other words,
 * their configuration can be passed in from the command line, from
 * configuration files, the network, or GUIs.  Typically, modules will
 * create a set of ports for communicating with other modules.  We
 * encourage, when possible, that at least one of those ports be
 * hooked up to the respond() method with attach().  For non graphical
 * applications, it is also convenient to hook up standard
 * input/output to the respond() method as well using
 * attachTerminal().
